## Compile And Execute

>- if you are not using an IDE and need to compila the proyect with the *"javac"* CLI tool
>>- i include a `java-exe.ps1` shell script

```shell
#class to compile
$Clases = " ./src/*.java"
#compile program and save the .class data in bin
$Compile = "javac -d ./bin" + "$Clases"
#just for testing purposes
$JavaCommand = "java -cp ./bin ./src/App.java -f ./src/App.java " + '/""/'
#execute the commands
$RunCommand = "$Compile" + " && " + "$JavaCommand"

Invoke-Expression $RunCommand
```
>- if you need to create the `.jar` file
>>- modify the script with the next command
```shell

#create jar file
$CreateJarFile = "jar -cfm joogle.jar Manifesto.txt -C bin ."
#execute the commands
$RunCommand = "$Compile" + " && " + "$JavaCommand" + " && " + "$CreateJarFile"

Invoke-Expression $RunCommand
```
