# Joogle
>- CLI exploration app like [Coogle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wK1HjnwDQng&t=1s) by Tsoding
>- Developed with Java

![expected output](./docs/expected_output.png)

## Dependencies 
>- [Java 17](https://www.oracle.com/es/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk17-windows)

## Folder Structure
>- thw workspace contains two folders where:
>>- `src`: is to maintain the sources
>>- `bin`: is to contain the `.class` files generated by the compile operation
>- if you want to change the folder structure remember to check if the powershell script is strill working

## Features
- [x] search the sentence within a file.
- [x] search the sentence within a directory.
- [x] search the sentence within all directories of the given directory
- [x] list all the files with the `.java` extensión
- [x] list all the méthods in the given directory
- [x] list all the TODO in the current proyect

## Usage

>- if you use the `.jar` file to execute.
>>- to search within a java file you specify the file
```shell
java -jar joogle.jar -f App.java /""/
```
>- to list all the files wiht the `.java` extensión
```shell
java -jar joogle.jar -lf .\src\
```
>- to list all the méthods within the given directory
```shell
java -jar joogle.jar -lm .\src\
```
>- to list all the TODO's in the current proyect
```shell
java -jar joogle.jar -lt .\src\
```
>>- to search within a directory you specify the directory
>>>- the search only includes the `.java` files within that directory
```shell
java -jar joogle.jar -d .\src\ /""/
```
>>- to search within directories
>>>- the search includes all the files in the given directory
>>>- if the directory includes more directories the search would go furder till reach the `.java` files
```shell
java -jar joogle.jar -D .\src\ /""/
```
>- if you need to execute the program without the `.jar` file
```shell
java -cp .\bin\ .\src\App.java -d .\src\ /""/
```
## Usage Explanation
>- search the sentence within a file
```shell
java -jar joogle.jar -f App.java /"void => ()"/
```
>>- `java -jar joogle.jar`: this execute the `.jar` file
>>- `-f App.java`: this indicates the file to search the sentence
>>- `/"void => ()"/`: this indicates the sentence to search within the file

>- if you want to search the sentence inside the given directory
>>- `-d .\src\`: this indicates to search the sentence inside of all the `.java` files in the given directory
>>>- if the directory contains more directories they are not taken into account

>- if you want to search the sentence inside all the files in the given directory
>>- `-D .\src\`: this indicates to search the sentence inside of all the `.java` files in all the routes of the given directory 
>>>- summary if the directory contains more directories they are taken into account

### Aditional take
>- if you want to combine the CLI options, you can but remember to change the file or directory of the search
```shell
java -jar joogle.jar -f App.java -d ./OtherProyect/ /"void => ()"/
```
>>- if you combine the CLI options remember to set the search sentence the same for both of the CLI options

>- if you indicate a different search for each one of the CLI options
>>- the output can be a little bit confusing
```shell
java -jar joogle.jar -f App.java /""/ -d ./OtherProyect/ /"void => ()"/
```
>- if you want aditional information in the CLI
```shell
java -jar joogle.jar --h
```
>>- this will output the each one of the CLI options

## Compile And Execute

>- if you are not using an IDE and need to compila the proyect with the *"javac"* CLI tool
>>- i include a `java-exe.ps1` shell script

```shell
#class to compile
$Clases = " ./src/*.java"
#compile program and save the .class data in bin
$Compile = "javac -d ./bin" + "$Clases"
#just for testing purposes
$JavaCommand = "java -cp ./bin ./src/App.java -f ./src/App.java " + '/""/'
#execute the commands
$RunCommand = "$Compile" + " && " + "$JavaCommand"

Invoke-Expression $RunCommand
```
>- if you need to create the `.jar` file
>>- first you need to create the `Manifesto.txt` file with the `Main-class: App` sentence
```txt
Main-class: App
```
>>- and modify the script with the next command
```shell

#create jar file
$CreateJarFile = "jar -cfm joogle.jar Manifesto.txt -C bin ."
#execute the commands
$RunCommand = "$Compile" + " && " + "$JavaCommand" + " && " + "$CreateJarFile"

Invoke-Expression $RunCommand
```
